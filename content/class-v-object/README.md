# The Difference Between a Class and an Object

## TLDR

You write a class to define the desired methods and properties, then use that class as an object to set and call those properties and methods.

## A Little More Detail

A class and an object represent the same concepts, but the class is the definition of the concepts you are trying to describe.  The class really only exists as a set of concepts about what something is and how it should operate.  All the properties (adjectives) and methods (verbs) are defined in the class (noun).  A class by itself cannot do anything useful becasue it is only the definition of a set of concepts.  To do something useful, you need to create an object from that class.

Creating an object from a class is where the real work takes place.  You may create as many objects from the same class as you need to do actual useful work.  When you create the class, you will set some or all of the properties.  Some or all of those properties may be set when you instantiate (create) the object from your class via its constructor (a special type of method), or you may be able to set more properties later by calling some of its methods (setters).  You will also be able to have your object perform certain functionality by calling its methods which could be methods that let you get information back out of the object (getters).  This may be a lot to take in at first, so lets proceed with some real-world examples.
