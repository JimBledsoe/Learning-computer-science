# Simple Code Example for Creating an Object from a Class in JavaScript

You can use any run-time environment to exercise this code - I use [repl.it](https://repl.it/@JimBledsoe/Learning-computer-science#code/simple) to run the code online, or you can use Node.js locally.

There are two files in this repository
- backpackClass.js - Defines a backpack class with a few properties and methods
- object.js - imports and creates an actual backpack from the class
